(1) The Biomimetics and Robotics Lab (BIRL) at Sun Yat-sen University has examples, demos, and tutorials.
    The idea came by studying their examples/demos particularly the demo using the kinect camera.
    Dr. Juan Rojas and his lab have created an excellent site to help others learn. 
    I initially used the publisher/subscriber concept that they used to learn, but then eliminated it and just
    directly calculated the joint angles and used the Baxter API to move the joints to the calculated
    positions. I did utilize how to get the joint angles using vectors and code snippets for getting a simple
    moving average filter.

(2) The Baxter Research Robot SDK website has multiple examples/tutorials.
    Code snippets on how to have Baxter carry certain actions were used from this website.

(4) Patrick Goebel has a two volume set called "ROS BY EXAMPLE".  This is an excellent reference and great way to
    learn. This program uses a concept from Vol 1, Chapter 10 on how to detect if the head frame has been detected.
    It is from his markers_from_tf.py script found in the skeleton_markers package located here:
    https://github.com/pirobot/skeleton_markers

    Also, Chapter 9 is devoted to speech recognition.  Here we use PocketSphinx from Carnegie Mellon University.
    Michael Ferguson wrote the package which interfaces ROS with PocketSphinx.  Both have BSD licenses.  
    
  
(5) The NeuroScience and Robotics laboratory at Northwestern University had a Baxter example.
    Used vector operations and concepts about how to calculate joint angles.

(6) "Programming Robots with ROS" by Morgan Quigley, Brian Gerkey, and William Smart.  Chapter 19 is devoted to making the robot talk using 
    pyttsx. Pyttsx is text to speech. Code was used from the book.  The code for the book is available at (i) and the documentation for
    pyttsx is available at (ii)

(7) "Skeletal Joint Smoothing White Paper".  This is a very helpful paper that describes concepts behind the need for filtering kinect camera
    data.  It then describes 10 different filters.  Here is the web address for the paper.
